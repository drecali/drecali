    <p>I'm a senior frontend engineer or web developer specializing in Typescript, React, Vite, Cypress, Playwright. I mostly code for work. A lot. I enjoy it so much I do it recreationally too. I've been working at <a href="https://lunit.io/en" target="_blank">Lunit</a> (medical AI company) since 2021. Our goal is to conquer cancer with AI. My team is in charge of web apps for medical annotation, project management, and data management. Our main objectives are to make the UX faster, more efficient, and accurate for medical annotators and project managers. Our work is vital to providing in-house AI reserachers with enormous volumes of accurately annotated data at a reasonable cost using both in-house and outsourced radiologists and pathologists, as well as internal quality-control steps.</p>

  <p>I've been hosting weekly coding meetups since 2019. I started one meetup group (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/freecodecamp.ulsan" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp Ulsan</a>) and revived another (<a href="https://meetup.com/fccseoul" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp Seoul</a>). I was first exposed to coding at a FreeCodeCamp Busan meetup and I've been hooked ever since. Here's a partial record of the meetups I hosted in the past. With very few exceptions I hosted all FCC Seoul meetups solo and the majority of FCC Ulsan meetups too. As of 2024, both meetups are still going strong, despite COVID, job changes, moving, traffic accidents, surgeries, veterinary emergencies, and occasional trolling.</p>

## [FreeCodeCamp Seoul](https://meetup.com/fccseoul)
  
Organizer/host from May 2020 to present.
  
When I moved to Seoul after 1 year of hosting FCC Ulsan events, I was surprised the FCC Seoul group was on a 3-year hiatus despite being in a world-class city in a technological powerhouse, so I resumed meetups following proper local social distancing policies. At FCC Seoul, I met a lot of great people. The meetups and community have helped me and others find better jobs, change careers, or discover the joys of coding. I still run the weekly IRL meetups while two co-admins help run the Discord community which one of them created.

## [FreeCodeCamp Ulsan](https://www.facebook.com/groups/freecodecamp.ulsan)

Organizer/host from Jan 2019 to Feb 2020.

I started FreeCodeCamp Ulsan group because I was first exposed to coding at a FreeCodeCamp Busan right when I was dissatisfied with my career. There, I found a supportive and motivating community that helped keep me consistent and change careers. I wanted to help others discover the joys of coding and find more fulfilling careers. Obviously, nerding out with others was a bonus. When I left Ulsan, I handed leadership to my trusted co-organizers.
